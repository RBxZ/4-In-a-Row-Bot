# 4-In-a-Row-Bot
A bot that is built on a PyGame platform of a 4 in a row game, which uses the minimax and alphabeta algorithms to find the best play.

The 4 in a row frame was given to me, and I made some changs to it. Then I created some versions of my own bot and improved it. 
I'm planning on using genetic programming in order to make the best utility functin possible.
